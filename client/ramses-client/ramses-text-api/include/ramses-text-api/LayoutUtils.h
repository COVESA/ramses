        * The bounding box can be offset from origin using offsetX/Y.

        * Similarly to GlyphMetrics, even when StringBoundingBox have zero width/height (which means there is no renderable data)
        * it can still have non-zero advance which should be taken into account by other StringBoundingBox if combined.
